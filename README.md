## Introduction
Graphs are versatile data structures used to represent connections between objects. Graph algorithms play a crucial role in solving a wide range of problems in computer science and beyond. This repository aims to provide implementations of some graph algorithms to the subject "Graph Theory" at the Federal University of Alagoas - UFAL.

## Algorithms
The following graph algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:
- Bellman-Ford's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Kosaraju's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm

## Usage
To use the implementations in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired algorithm implementation.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
4. Execute the compiled binary to run the algorithm on your input graph.

Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-algorithms.git
cd graph-algorithms
g++ dijkstra.cpp -o dijkstra
./dijkstra
